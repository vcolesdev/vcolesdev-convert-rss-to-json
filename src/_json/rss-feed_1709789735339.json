This allows you to combine these cards for fun combos, as long as the cards drawn are suitable for that. The designs of the 70 spirits that you can tame are full of creativity, one more adorable than the other. Also very cute is that your pet team follows you around like little ducklings when you move on the map, although sometimes they tend to get in your way, especially when farming; however, there’s an option to make them stop following you. The pets that you don’t bring into battle can be stored either in a barn or in a research center, the difference between these two being that the latter does not require any maintenance on your part. The pets stored in your barn need to be fed constantly and in return, they drop items required for quest completion, for crafting or which can be sold for some extra income.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2537285189283472098/559B4E096FBBEF0F3573B969C68990EA3CED35EF/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Each of these two aspects of the gameplay has its own strengths and weaknesses. For instance, the crafting part is very straightforward, requiring only a couple of steps even for more complex items. The tools don’t have that annoying durability mechanic that requires you to always craft a new one every few days. The plants require daily watering (aside from rainy days), but the watering can doesn’t ever need to be filled and besides, you can just craft sprinklers to water your plants automatically. There are plenty of basic resources to gather (although trees and grass don’t automatically respawn) and the mines that you can open on each island are rich in minerals, chests that drop blueprints, and spirits to tame. On the other hand, a lot of the items required for progression (such as the barn or essential flying items) are gated behind the acquisition of Moonstones. Up until close to the endgame where you get a blueprint to mass-produce them, likely for transitioning into a sandbox kind of gameplay, these are extremely rare: each island contains only one per season, and very few bosses or chests drop any. Due to their scarcity, the progression is extremely slow, and exploring as many islands as possible quickly becomes your main goal. This in turn requires you to be able to fly greater distances (to reach further islands) and to be equipped to fight any enemies that you might find there.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2537285189283474791/1C4C791982312295C7D73F3E3618838D3EC166BA/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In regards to the deckbuilding aspect, you get to expand your deck by one random card (chosen out of three possible ones that the game offers) every time you level your pet. Upgrading or removing a card is possible, however you will need special tokens for that, which are also quite rare (you can find one every few islands). Thus, while the battles are really fun, the deckbuilding mechanic is rather restrictive, as you don’t have full flexibility in customizing your deck. <em>Moonstone Island</em> also offers 30 rather lengthy, yet very exciting dungeons, where you get to solve little puzzles, uncover chests and fight higher-level spirits.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2537285189283472560/95B43039C6584B5383B4CA6912B4FA9522598888/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Like pretty much any other game belonging to the genre, <em>Moonstone Island</em> is quite addictive. There’s always something to do or explore, and your stamina bar allows you to perform enough activities to keep you hooked throughout the entire in-game day. The game keeps things really fresh by throwing this mix of mechanics at you, which offers endless possibilities. However, keep in mind that the farming aspect is not the main focus of <em>Moonstone Island</em>. Instead, it’s used only as a support system for the pet battles, which is the actual essence of the gameplay.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><sup>Disclaimer: This review is based on a press preview copy of the game, kindly provided by Raw Fury via The Indie Game Collective.</sup></p>\\n\\n\\n<iframe id=\\\"wp-steam-shortcode\\\" class=\\\"wp-steam-shortcode\\\" style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 190px; border: 0;\\\" src=\\\"//store.steampowered.com/widget/1658150?t=\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\"></iframe>\\n<p>The post <a href=\\\"https://lillycorner.com/2024/02/17/moonstone-island/\\\">Moonstone Island</a> appeared first on <a href=\\\"https://lillycorner.com\\\">Lilly&#039;s Corner Reviews</a>.</p>\\n\",\n      \"enclosures\": [],\n      \"content_encoded\": \"\\n<p>If Stardew Valley and Pokemon had a baby, that would be <em>Moonstone Island</em> &#8211; although a lot of people prefer to compare it to Slay the Spire rather than Pokemon.

Thus, while the battles are really fun, the deckbuilding mechanic is rather restrictive, as you don’t have full flexibility in customizing your deck. <em>Moonstone Island</em> also offers 30 rather lengthy, yet very exciting dungeons, where you get to solve little puzzles, uncover chests and fight higher-level spirits.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2537285189283472560/95B43039C6584B5383B4CA6912B4FA9522598888/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Like pretty much any other game belonging to the genre, <em>Moonstone Island</em> is quite addictive. There’s always something to do or explore, and your stamina bar allows you to perform enough activities to keep you hooked throughout the entire in-game day. The game keeps things really fresh by throwing this mix of mechanics at you, which offers endless possibilities. However, keep in mind that the farming aspect is not the main focus of <em>Moonstone Island</em>. Instead, it’s used only as a support system for the pet battles, which is the actual essence of the gameplay.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><sup>Disclaimer: This review is based on a press preview copy of the game, kindly provided by Raw Fury via The Indie Game Collective.</sup></p>\\n\\n\\n<iframe id=\\\"wp-steam-shortcode\\\" class=\\\"wp-steam-shortcode\\\" style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 190px; border: 0;\\\" src=\\\"//store.steampowered.com/widget/1658150?t=\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\"></iframe>\\n<p>The post <a href=\\\"https://lillycorner.com/2024/02/17/moonstone-island/\\\">Moonstone Island</a> appeared first on <a href=\\\"https://lillycorner.com\\\">Lilly&#039;s Corner Reviews</a>.</p>\\n\",\n      \"media\": {}\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"https://lillycorner.com/?p=1110\",\n      \"title\": \"Wanted: Dead\",\n      \"description\": \"<p>Wanted: Dead is a gory and challenging action game with fast-paced, unforgiving combat.

Oftentimes when you are fighting enemies up close, the too-close camera position makes it hard to see enemies to your sides and behind you.

Further harming your spatial awareness are two other issues: your teammates are too difficult to distinguish from enemies in the heat of battle, especially on dark levels, and it is too hard to keep track of which enemies are still alive and thus dangers you have to be aware of. Since you can partially dismember many of your opponents without fully incapacitating them, just seeing gore isn’t a clear indicator. The only clear ways to know is a tiny visual indicator showing XP gain, and the very repetitive death scream you hear from most of the enemy types.

While&nbsp;<em>Crystar</em>’s story is a personal one (the protagonist journeys through purgatory to find her younger sister&#8217;s soul and bring her back to life),&nbsp;<em>Crymachina</em>’s narrative takes place on a grander scale in a futuristic setting, even if it&#8217;s not quite a space opera.&nbsp;<em>Crymachina</em>’s core message is also deeply impactful: humanity is not given by being born as a&nbsp;<em>human</em>, but by having a heart, a soul that loves and protects the ones that it cares for.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2319984511063828253/E5DBBE007681C7EBE76545C48767E83D9933B36B/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Two thousand years ago, an unknown disease with a 100% fatality rate and a mysterious cause wiped out more than 20% of the population. Because of resource scarcity, the rest of the population engaged in a war and eventually went extinct. In their last moments, the remaining surviving humans created a gigantic space structure (called &#8220;Eden&#8221;) in hopes of preserving their species. Eden was equipped with eight Dei ex Machina (machine gods): self-evolving, artificial life forms whose only purpose was mankind&#8217;s resurrection. The game’s storyline starts with the sudden disappearance of the first Deus ex Machina, which leads to a war for control among the other Dei ex Machinas, causing havoc on Eden. To overpower the machines, command them back into order and install peace, a &#8220;Real Human&#8221; is needed, as to machines humans are gods. For this purpose, the eighth Deus ex Machina (Enoa) revives a young human girl (Leben) by encasing her soul into a synthetic frame, essentially transforming her into a battle machine. The team led by Enoa and otherwise consisting of Leben and two other girls, (Ami and Mikoto) will try to make their way through various virtual areas of the space structure, fixing the corrupted machine code and overwriting it with Enoa’s, while also trying to gather enough ExP for Leben (the “chosen one”) to become a &#8220;Real Human&#8221;.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2319984511063842371/6681A2BDEDF61C27FD4559454789D3746B0F0CEB/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Gameplay</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Both games use the same formula of alternating between individual missions and story bits. However,&nbsp;<em>Crymachina</em>’s story is much more ample than&nbsp;<em>Crystar</em>’s, covering most of the gameplay. The missions, which in&nbsp;<em>Crystar</em>&nbsp;took 30-45 minutes each, were spawned over several floors with lots of side paths and had dozens of enemies to fight, are now squeezed into very short and linear runs that usually take less than 10 minutes and end in a boss fight. Barely any enemy is encountered and every mission is basically a straight and quick path to the boss, with some of them having an optional micro puzzle that unlocks a high-level miniboss.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2319984511063843597/1DB5D480134073478E58B7D9CD44BD86C14BA59E/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This 180° turn in the design might have been a response to the complaints about&nbsp;<em>Crystar</em>&nbsp;that the gameplay is too repetitive or boring. Personally, I find this decision to strongly downgrade the fun of the game. While the environments are extremely spacious and beautifully crafted, they’re not meant to be explored. You’re not even expected to spend much time traversing them, because there’s almost no one to fight (<em>Crystar</em>&nbsp;has at least ten times more enemies). The boss fights are rather lengthy, thus most of the “action” part of the game will be spent in the boss room. I love the visual novel aspect of the game and that roughly 75% of the time goes into reading through the story, but during the action parts of the game, my fingers were itching for some quick hack-and-slash action and unfortunately,&nbsp;<em>Crymachina</em>&nbsp;failed to fully satisfy this itch. It’s considered a hack-and-slash game, although… there is&nbsp;<em>not nearly enough</em>&nbsp;hacking and slashing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In each of the missions, you will play as one of the three girls, with you being able to freely pick which one of them to bring into battle only during side missions or in the additional content that you can unlock after the main story ends. Unlike in&nbsp;<em>Crystar</em>, where all four playable characters were always available and you were also allowed to switch between them mid-run or even mid-fight, here the main missions are usually locked to a specific character.

Some say that&nbsp;<em>Crymachina</em>&nbsp;is a much-improved version of&nbsp;<em>Crystar</em>, but as someone who played through both games one after another, I beg to differ.

While&nbsp;<em>Crystar</em>’s story is a personal one (the protagonist journeys through purgatory to find her younger sister&#8217;s soul and bring her back to life),&nbsp;<em>Crymachina</em>’s narrative takes place on a grander scale in a futuristic setting, even if it&#8217;s not quite a space opera.&nbsp;<em>Crymachina</em>’s core message is also deeply impactful: humanity is not given by being born as a&nbsp;<em>human</em>, but by having a heart, a soul that loves and protects the ones that it cares for.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2319984511063828253/E5DBBE007681C7EBE76545C48767E83D9933B36B/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Two thousand years ago, an unknown disease with a 100% fatality rate and a mysterious cause wiped out more than 20% of the population. Because of resource scarcity, the rest of the population engaged in a war and eventually went extinct. In their last moments, the remaining surviving humans created a gigantic space structure (called &#8220;Eden&#8221;) in hopes of preserving their species. Eden was equipped with eight Dei ex Machina (machine gods): self-evolving, artificial life forms whose only purpose was mankind&#8217;s resurrection. The game’s storyline starts with the sudden disappearance of the first Deus ex Machina, which leads to a war for control among the other Dei ex Machinas, causing havoc on Eden. To overpower the machines, command them back into order and install peace, a &#8220;Real Human&#8221; is needed, as to machines humans are gods. For this purpose, the eighth Deus ex Machina (Enoa) revives a young human girl (Leben) by encasing her soul into a synthetic frame, essentially transforming her into a battle machine. The team led by Enoa and otherwise consisting of Leben and two other girls, (Ami and Mikoto) will try to make their way through various virtual areas of the space structure, fixing the corrupted machine code and overwriting it with Enoa’s, while also trying to gather enough ExP for Leben (the “chosen one”) to become a &#8220;Real Human&#8221;.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2319984511063842371/6681A2BDEDF61C27FD4559454789D3746B0F0CEB/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Gameplay</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Both games use the same formula of alternating between individual missions and story bits. However,&nbsp;<em>Crymachina</em>’s story is much more ample than&nbsp;<em>Crystar</em>’s, covering most of the gameplay. The missions, which in&nbsp;<em>Crystar</em>&nbsp;took 30-45 minutes each, were spawned over several floors with lots of side paths and had dozens of enemies to fight, are now squeezed into very short and linear runs that usually take less than 10 minutes and end in a boss fight. Barely any enemy is encountered and every mission is basically a straight and quick path to the boss, with some of them having an optional micro puzzle that unlocks a high-level miniboss.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2319984511063843597/1DB5D480134073478E58B7D9CD44BD86C14BA59E/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This 180° turn in the design might have been a response to the complaints about&nbsp;<em>Crystar</em>&nbsp;that the gameplay is too repetitive or boring. Personally, I find this decision to strongly downgrade the fun of the game. While the environments are extremely spacious and beautifully crafted, they’re not meant to be explored. You’re not even expected to spend much time traversing them, because there’s almost no one to fight (<em>Crystar</em>&nbsp;has at least ten times more enemies). The boss fights are rather lengthy, thus most of the “action” part of the game will be spent in the boss room. I love the visual novel aspect of the game and that roughly 75% of the time goes into reading through the story, but during the action parts of the game, my fingers were itching for some quick hack-and-slash action and unfortunately,&nbsp;<em>Crymachina</em>&nbsp;failed to fully satisfy this itch. It’s considered a hack-and-slash game, although… there is&nbsp;<em>not nearly enough</em>&nbsp;hacking and slashing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In each of the missions, you will play as one of the three girls, with you being able to freely pick which one of them to bring into battle only during side missions or in the additional content that you can unlock after the main story ends. Unlike in&nbsp;<em>Crystar</em>, where all four playable characters were always available and you were also allowed to switch between them mid-run or even mid-fight, here the main missions are usually locked to a specific character. This means that you will have to equally level up and gear up all three girls to be able to overcome all levels / boss fights, which will require a bit of grinding.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2319984511063832826/FCBB981360077BE8BD20D7B64EB57621203FDCC9/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In between missions, the girls gather for a tea party in a virtual garden, where they will chit-chat about their progress or plan their further actions.

The virtual garden also acts like a main hub for the game, allowing you to transform the items collected from missions into pieces of gear (using the same “cry” mechanic from&nbsp;<em>Crystar</em>), organize your equipment, upgrade combat abilities, consult the encyclopedia of enemies and story concepts, etc.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Combat</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The combat in&nbsp;<em>Crymachina</em>&nbsp;retains its simplicity from&nbsp;<em>Crystar</em>, which for me is one of the most enjoyable aspects of both games.

It’s the kind of game that some people, myself included, love because of how relaxing and uncomplicated the gameplay is, while others complain specifically about its simplicity and repetitiveness.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Crystar</em>&nbsp;tells the story of Rei, a 15-years-old girl who finds herself transported from the living world into purgatory. When the soul of her younger sister is destroyed, she signs a pact with the two demon-overseers of the purgatory to collect 7 “Ideas” These are special crystals that contain the condensed tears generated by the self-consciousness of the purgatory souls reminiscing about their past human life. Rei wants to exchange them for the revival of her sister&#8217;s soul. Essentially, this means cleaning up the purgatory of restless souls by defeating them in combat, absorbing their memories and thoughts, then purifying them into Ideas.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2312100041498233956/D72A60C994CA9C6941CAF803E4E8B65F08A4E2BB/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The game is split into several sequential missions, and completing one of them will automatically return you to Rei’s room which acts as a game lobby. Here you’ll be able to purify the essence of the purgatory specters into shards of armor and combine them into pieces of gear that you can then equip. You can also improve them with passive bonuses, check the diary that describes the story events in a condensed form, or visit the codex of discovered enemies and read fragments of their backstories. You can also interact with the adorable Samoyed dog that guards Rei’s bed, or have phone calls with other characters (when this is required by the story).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2312100041498231250/84067AD0B599C88296E61AA5927B78D4AA0801BF/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As the game progresses, Rei gains three other allies (all of them being playable characters), and you will be able to switch to any of them during combat anytime. One is a ranged character, while the other two, just like Rei, are melee, but have different fighting styles and abilities, making them more or less suitable for certain boss fights. The missions are straightforward and usually spawn over several floors, which are sequentially visited. There are different paths to take for each level (all converging to the common exit) and extra rooms to explore harboring a mix of regular enemies and more difficult ones. The map makes it very easy to navigate the levels, as it shows you a top-down schematic of the rooms and the connections between them, together with undiscovered areas or paths.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2312100041498230841/F54EE128FE116BB97A65381E5C8637CEA0D0D753/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In terms of the combat mechanics, these are extremely basic. Rei has a light attack and a heavy attack, together with four out of eight possible spells (for each character) that you can discover by progressing through the game (some being upgraded versions of the basic ones), and which you can freely choose to equip. Parrying is not a thing in&nbsp;<em>Crystar</em>; instead, you’ll avoid attacks by dodging. The enemies are very slow and there’s a huge time window (several seconds) from the start of the attack animation to the actual hit, thus you’ll have plenty of time to avoid the damage &#8211; although this becomes somewhat more challenging in bigger groups of enemies, as you need to keep track of all their individual timings.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2312100041498233009/98DA620F67EF643EC5F571B514C88DBE8D1D1531/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Getting hit is not a big problem though, as the enemies do rather low damage. Hitting enemies will recover your SP, while HP can be recovered by eating consumables. These can be configured to be used “automatically”, meaning that whenever you reach a certain HP level an HP consumable will automatically be used. You don’t even need to monitor that, as the game literally makes you invincible as long as you have consumables in your inventory &#8211; which can be bought from the peddler at the start of each level, and they’re even very cheap. Attacks will also replenish your “tear” gauge &#8211; this is a mechanic that acts like an “ult” (ultimate): when it’s full, you can unleash a very powerful attack that lasts several seconds. There are no attack combos aside from a 3-times light attack, but there’s a hit counter that tracks your successful hits, which is broken if you don’t perform an attack in a 3-second window. The higher the hit count, the faster the “tear” fills.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2312100041498233310/D122A79530240A682B1E2584E7DAC5B070BCDC2F/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Four different endings are available in&nbsp;<em>Crystar</em>, the first one reachable after playing through the entire game once, and the rest by replaying the last few chapters. Each of the subsequent playthroughs reveals a new aspect of the story, adding new layers to the plot that are built on top of what was previously revealed during the previous endings. Despite the innocent vibe given by the casual banter exchanged between the cute anime girl characters, the writing often deals with sensitive topics such as suicide, depression, abuse, and regrets but the final revelations have a pretty different vibe and are rather unpredictable because of how random they appear to be.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2312100041498234260/F9310BE378196D1A38A344115028490650699F35/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>While most reviewers find the repetitive and simplistic combat to be the weakest point of the game, I personally think that the story is the one that lacks cohesion, complexity and clarity. It’s certainly enjoyable as it is, but the characters don’t appear to be consistent throughout the whole game. At times, this disappointed me, but other times they brought in an element of surprise. Another weak point is the lack of diversity regarding the enemy types. Even though the compendium lists 99 enemy types that one can encounter throughout the game, aside from sixteen unique bosses there are only eight categories of enemies, and in each category the enemies are just reskins of each other, otherwise having the exact same set of attacks.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2312100041498233599/840BDE332386A789B40F8DCC523826ABEF044DCB/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Crystar</em>&nbsp;is a very decent game that will keep you occupied for around 40 hours of story and another 20 hours of grinding if you want to reach 100% completion (max level, all entries in the compendium filled, all missions completed, etc).

It’s the kind of game that some people, myself included, love because of how relaxing and uncomplicated the gameplay is, while others complain specifically about its simplicity and repetitiveness.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Crystar</em>&nbsp;tells the story of Rei, a 15-years-old girl who finds herself transported from the living world into purgatory. When the soul of her younger sister is destroyed, she signs a pact with the two demon-overseers of the purgatory to collect 7 “Ideas” These are special crystals that contain the condensed tears generated by the self-consciousness of the purgatory souls reminiscing about their past human life. Rei wants to exchange them for the revival of her sister&#8217;s soul. Essentially, this means cleaning up the purgatory of restless souls by defeating them in combat, absorbing their memories and thoughts, then purifying them into Ideas.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2312100041498233956/D72A60C994CA9C6941CAF803E4E8B65F08A4E2BB/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The game is split into several sequential missions, and completing one of them will automatically return you to Rei’s room which acts as a game lobby. Here you’ll be able to purify the essence of the purgatory specters into shards of armor and combine them into pieces of gear that you can then equip. You can also improve them with passive bonuses, check the diary that describes the story events in a condensed form, or visit the codex of discovered enemies and read fragments of their backstories. You can also interact with the adorable Samoyed dog that guards Rei’s bed, or have phone calls with other characters (when this is required by the story).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2312100041498231250/84067AD0B599C88296E61AA5927B78D4AA0801BF/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As the game progresses, Rei gains three other allies (all of them being playable characters), and you will be able to switch to any of them during combat anytime. One is a ranged character, while the other two, just like Rei, are melee, but have different fighting styles and abilities, making them more or less suitable for certain boss fights. The missions are straightforward and usually spawn over several floors, which are sequentially visited. There are different paths to take for each level (all converging to the common exit) and extra rooms to explore harboring a mix of regular enemies and more difficult ones. The map makes it very easy to navigate the levels, as it shows you a top-down schematic of the rooms and the connections between them, together with undiscovered areas or paths.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2312100041498230841/F54EE128FE116BB97A65381E5C8637CEA0D0D753/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In terms of the combat mechanics, these are extremely basic. Rei has a light attack and a heavy attack, together with four out of eight possible spells (for each character) that you can discover by progressing through the game (some being upgraded versions of the basic ones), and which you can freely choose to equip. Parrying is not a thing in&nbsp;<em>Crystar</em>; instead, you’ll avoid attacks by dodging. The enemies are very slow and there’s a huge time window (several seconds) from the start of the attack animation to the actual hit, thus you’ll have plenty of time to avoid the damage &#8211; although this becomes somewhat more challenging in bigger groups of enemies, as you need to keep track of all their individual timings.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2312100041498233009/98DA620F67EF643EC5F571B514C88DBE8D1D1531/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Getting hit is not a big problem though, as the enemies do rather low damage. Hitting enemies will recover your SP, while HP can be recovered by eating consumables. These can be configured to be used “automatically”, meaning that whenever you reach a certain HP level an HP consumable will automatically be used. You don’t even need to monitor that, as the game literally makes you invincible as long as you have consumables in your inventory &#8211; which can be bought from the peddler at the start of each level, and they’re even very cheap. Attacks will also replenish your “tear” gauge &#8211; this is a mechanic that acts like an “ult” (ultimate): when it’s full, you can unleash a very powerful attack that lasts several seconds. There are no attack combos aside from a 3-times light attack, but there’s a hit counter that tracks your successful hits, which is broken if you don’t perform an attack in a 3-second window. The higher the hit count, the faster the “tear” fills.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2312100041498233310/D122A79530240A682B1E2584E7DAC5B070BCDC2F/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Four different endings are available in&nbsp;<em>Crystar</em>, the first one reachable after playing through the entire game once, and the rest by replaying the last few chapters. Each of the subsequent playthroughs reveals a new aspect of the story, adding new layers to the plot that are built on top of what was previously revealed during the previous endings. Despite the innocent vibe given by the casual banter exchanged between the cute anime girl characters, the writing often deals with sensitive topics such as suicide, depression, abuse, and regrets but the final revelations have a pretty different vibe and are rather unpredictable because of how random they appear to be.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2312100041498234260/F9310BE378196D1A38A344115028490650699F35/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>While most reviewers find the repetitive and simplistic combat to be the weakest point of the game, I personally think that the story is the one that lacks cohesion, complexity and clarity. It’s certainly enjoyable as it is, but the characters don’t appear to be consistent throughout the whole game. At times, this disappointed me, but other times they brought in an element of surprise. Another weak point is the lack of diversity regarding the enemy types. Even though the compendium lists 99 enemy types that one can encounter throughout the game, aside from sixteen unique bosses there are only eight categories of enemies, and in each category the enemies are just reskins of each other, otherwise having the exact same set of attacks.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2312100041498233599/840BDE332386A789B40F8DCC523826ABEF044DCB/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Crystar</em>&nbsp;is a very decent game that will keep you occupied for around 40 hours of story and another 20 hours of grinding if you want to reach 100% completion (max level, all entries in the compendium filled, all missions completed, etc).

It does not reflect the state of previous or subsequent updates. As the game is in Early Access, major changes are expected.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In <em>Forever Skies</em>, the skies of a (partially procedurally generated) ravaged Earth are yours for the taking. It’s a game along the lines of <em>Subnautica</em>, <em>Raft</em> or <em>Green Hell</em> – titles the developers at <em>Far From Home</em> openly cite as inspiration. Expect exploration (including story elements), survival elements, resource gathering and crafting. Instead of building underwater bases, a floating home, or jungle huts, you commandeer and expand your very own airship, balloon and all. Flying to spire-like platforms and exploring (and looting) those makes up the majority of this game. The looting experience is reminiscent of picking up loose loot in Fallout titles, except that the derelict platforms here require careful movement, as any steep falls without solid ground below most definitely result in your death. Below a certain altitude, you and your ship take damage from dust storms, and if you descend low enough, you die, so don’t expect trips to the planet’s surface.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2263685075957569791/C776985EDD28D038DC9C4717D270730E40AB7DBD/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The afore-mentioned October update added another level of complexity to the game’s survival elements. Energy, health, nutrition and hydration bars need to be maintained at a high level to keep your character&#8217;s immunity score up. Outside the tutorial area, you can contract viruses and then have to cure them. How fast these meters drain depends on the chosen difficulty setting, and that furthermore affects the effects of death. On easy, there is no penalty for death, whereas on normal and hard, you lose a percentage of your resources, and there’s a permadeath mode too. Due to the risk of falling from a structure or your ship after a careless misstep, I would only recommend it to true masochists. After a recent update, the difficulty setting can be changed at any time. While there is some hostile flora and fauna to be found, the developers have said they won’t add human enemies to fight, and thus there obviously won’t be ship-to-ship combat. Enemies are meant more as progression checks that you can get past once you have the right items. They are fairly static and not meant to challenge your FPS skills.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>While keeping your character alive and your airship intact requires a constant flow of resources, the most basic ones are provided very generously. Floating debris is enough to keep your insect catcher and water condenser going, and cooking what you obtain via the insect catcher is the primary way of obtaining food. As these are effectively infinite resources, and you have an effectively limitless number of locations to land on and loot, <em>Forever Skies</em> is not a game about making do with the last resources left on a destroyed world. At the same time, it is not about building a self-sufficient base that produces advanced resources to keep growing, either. While getting the bare necessities in a pinch is no problem, any time a specific rare part is needed to craft something, that tends to mean a trip to a location it’ll spawn in. This goes from batteries for keeping your hand-held tools charged to different liquids used in crafting recipes. The December 2023 update will add gardening, but until then, to deal with viruses on hard difficulty you might need a trip to a greenhouse location, and since collected plants spoil over time, you cannot stockpile them either. Obtaining new technologies also requires you to scan devices or collect datapads in specific location types, rather than points for the unlock tree as seen in sandbox crafting games.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2263685075957573665/3EE8FAEC723CA5E1EE7F12E9C112EBB19BA82F52/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Your airship is constructed from square rooms that snap together, which is once more reminiscent of Subnautica. Stations that produce or process are placed inside your ship, while placing catwalk tiles on the outside is required for stations that interact with the environment, like water collectors, insect catchers, and the all-important extractor, with which you suck up resources from certain big stationary objects and floating debris alike. Adding more or better engines lets you go faster, additional turbines enable you to reach higher altitudes (and thus higher-tier structures), and increasing the size of the balloon on top (or even adding additional balloons on a truly big airship) boosts the lift capacity so that you can build a bigger boat. The chosen shape of course strongly influences how many obstacles one usually collides with and how hard it is to park at a structure.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I called the game <em>partially</em> procedurally generated because despite there being a few biomes recognizable at a distance, the platforms you spend most of your time on come from a relatively small pool of prefabs.

It does not reflect the state of previous or subsequent updates. As the game is in Early Access, major changes are expected.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In <em>Forever Skies</em>, the skies of a (partially procedurally generated) ravaged Earth are yours for the taking. It’s a game along the lines of <em>Subnautica</em>, <em>Raft</em> or <em>Green Hell</em> – titles the developers at <em>Far From Home</em> openly cite as inspiration. Expect exploration (including story elements), survival elements, resource gathering and crafting. Instead of building underwater bases, a floating home, or jungle huts, you commandeer and expand your very own airship, balloon and all. Flying to spire-like platforms and exploring (and looting) those makes up the majority of this game. The looting experience is reminiscent of picking up loose loot in Fallout titles, except that the derelict platforms here require careful movement, as any steep falls without solid ground below most definitely result in your death. Below a certain altitude, you and your ship take damage from dust storms, and if you descend low enough, you die, so don’t expect trips to the planet’s surface.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2263685075957569791/C776985EDD28D038DC9C4717D270730E40AB7DBD/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The afore-mentioned October update added another level of complexity to the game’s survival elements. Energy, health, nutrition and hydration bars need to be maintained at a high level to keep your character&#8217;s immunity score up. Outside the tutorial area, you can contract viruses and then have to cure them. How fast these meters drain depends on the chosen difficulty setting, and that furthermore affects the effects of death. On easy, there is no penalty for death, whereas on normal and hard, you lose a percentage of your resources, and there’s a permadeath mode too. Due to the risk of falling from a structure or your ship after a careless misstep, I would only recommend it to true masochists. After a recent update, the difficulty setting can be changed at any time. While there is some hostile flora and fauna to be found, the developers have said they won’t add human enemies to fight, and thus there obviously won’t be ship-to-ship combat. Enemies are meant more as progression checks that you can get past once you have the right items. They are fairly static and not meant to challenge your FPS skills.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>While keeping your character alive and your airship intact requires a constant flow of resources, the most basic ones are provided very generously. Floating debris is enough to keep your insect catcher and water condenser going, and cooking what you obtain via the insect catcher is the primary way of obtaining food. As these are effectively infinite resources, and you have an effectively limitless number of locations to land on and loot, <em>Forever Skies</em> is not a game about making do with the last resources left on a destroyed world. At the same time, it is not about building a self-sufficient base that produces advanced resources to keep growing, either. While getting the bare necessities in a pinch is no problem, any time a specific rare part is needed to craft something, that tends to mean a trip to a location it’ll spawn in. This goes from batteries for keeping your hand-held tools charged to different liquids used in crafting recipes. The December 2023 update will add gardening, but until then, to deal with viruses on hard difficulty you might need a trip to a greenhouse location, and since collected plants spoil over time, you cannot stockpile them either. Obtaining new technologies also requires you to scan devices or collect datapads in specific location types, rather than points for the unlock tree as seen in sandbox crafting games.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2263685075957573665/3EE8FAEC723CA5E1EE7F12E9C112EBB19BA82F52/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Your airship is constructed from square rooms that snap together, which is once more reminiscent of Subnautica. Stations that produce or process are placed inside your ship, while placing catwalk tiles on the outside is required for stations that interact with the environment, like water collectors, insect catchers, and the all-important extractor, with which you suck up resources from certain big stationary objects and floating debris alike. Adding more or better engines lets you go faster, additional turbines enable you to reach higher altitudes (and thus higher-tier structures), and increasing the size of the balloon on top (or even adding additional balloons on a truly big airship) boosts the lift capacity so that you can build a bigger boat. The chosen shape of course strongly influences how many obstacles one usually collides with and how hard it is to park at a structure.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I called the game <em>partially</em> procedurally generated because despite there being a few biomes recognizable at a distance, the platforms you spend most of your time on come from a relatively small pool of prefabs. Some of these also come with additional variations, but not in a way that makes them feel distinct – compare it to how every time you start a mission in <em>Icarus</em> or <em>Payday 2</em>, there are some subtle changes to the level. Time will tell if the developers can spruce up their procedural generation to a degree that could rival the exploration variety of, say, the static world in Subnautica.

As Tessa tries to understand what happened there, strange and unexplained occurrences begin to take place, and the player starts questioning what is real or not. <em>Monolith</em>’s storyline is not only a sci-fi one but also one about self-discovery and personal growth. While the plot is overall well-written and deeply engaging with its multiple twists, I found the ending to be its weakest point. It does answer all the questions and wraps up all storylines, yet the final revelation is to some extent predictable and another extent disappointing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2228779642348537077/73EC1DB61500D18B16095BE98322512F426CF97A/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Monolith</em>’s puzzles are somewhere between easy and average to figure out, with only a couple of them being on the unintuitive or obtuse side. In comparison to older point &amp; click games, the locations are rather contained in one-chapter areas and with one exception in which the locations are a maze to traverse, the rooms / scenes are positioned in a way that allows efficient pathing. I also really liked the fact that all the objects to be picked up were distinguishable from the background yet still perfectly blended into it; no pixel-hunting was required as they were in most cases clearly visible. On the other hand, I would have preferred if the items were automatically discarded from the inventory if they had no further use. As it is now, the inventory is often filled with non-relevant items that were previously gathered.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2228779642348537971/2326108E325E44ADE118E776B6CD49544C89204F/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The aspect in which&nbsp;<em>Monolith</em>&nbsp;shines is the enigmatic atmosphere that it conveys and the strong cinematic component of the game. It’s probably one of the most cinematic point &amp; click experiences I’ve had, filled with beautifully hand-drawn video cutscenes and ample dialogue snippets. Unlike in older point &amp; click games, where a certain character has multiple dialogue options of which the majority are rather irrelevant to the story,&nbsp;<em>Monolith</em>&nbsp;transforms its dialogues into lengthy cutscenes that will always add something new to the plot or reveal some important piece of information for the story. The game is also fully voiced in both English and German and overall has some decent voice acting (with some small exceptions when the lines voiced by Tessa’s robot companion don’t flow smoothly). Judging by the German demo video, the English voice-overs are much better than the German ones.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2228779642348538550/9B679CB6558DBFFC7D6F857ED58263D7B80AAEA8/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For those that prefer a more casual approach at point &amp; click games, three important features have been added to the game: a hotspot button that reveals all interactable items, an in-game walkthrough with only the relevant section visible for the room you’re in, and all minigames can be skipped. Using any of these will not prevent you from obtaining 100% completion, however, all 14 achievements are missable. As there is no chapter selection at the moment, you’ll need to rely heavily on an achievement guide if you want to obtain all of them. The game does have a save feature which is helpful if you want to replay certain bits. It comes in handy for those achievements that require you to solve a minigame in a certain amount of steps / in a specific way, or under a time limit (don’t worry, the latter is very easy).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2228779642348538237/36D3CBC70A51A104B5757A10032E799701A6FD74/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>While I deeply enjoy playing point &amp; click games, I dislike certain aspects of the core gameplay of the older games, such as pixel-hunting, lots of back &amp; forth between scenes and illogical puzzles. <em>Monolith</em> successfully managed to avoid pretty much all my pet peeves, while also providing enough verbal guidance for puzzles (during world interactions or when examining inventory items) as well as through the hotspots map and the in-game walkthrough. The game’s difficulty is just about right and it doesn’t interrupt the immersion given by the generous amount of movie-like cutscenes. The story was engaging and kept me on my toes until close to the end. Both Tessa as well as her companion robot are likable characters. Their dialogue exchanges are fun and filled with snappy remarks.

She slowly remembers seeing a rhythmic light in the distance and deciding to travel there together with her sidekick flying robot, in the hopes that she will then be able to transmit a distress signal to be picked up by a ship that might travel on one of the surrounding flight paths. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2228779642348536152/C4ED27062E488A324567D4658A93BE47B81A19B9/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The mystery deepens when she reaches her destination only to find an abandoned intergalactic station, overtaken by wild vegetation. As Tessa tries to understand what happened there, strange and unexplained occurrences begin to take place, and the player starts questioning what is real or not. <em>Monolith</em>’s storyline is not only a sci-fi one but also one about self-discovery and personal growth. While the plot is overall well-written and deeply engaging with its multiple twists, I found the ending to be its weakest point. It does answer all the questions and wraps up all storylines, yet the final revelation is to some extent predictable and another extent disappointing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2228779642348537077/73EC1DB61500D18B16095BE98322512F426CF97A/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Monolith</em>’s puzzles are somewhere between easy and average to figure out, with only a couple of them being on the unintuitive or obtuse side. In comparison to older point &amp; click games, the locations are rather contained in one-chapter areas and with one exception in which the locations are a maze to traverse, the rooms / scenes are positioned in a way that allows efficient pathing. I also really liked the fact that all the objects to be picked up were distinguishable from the background yet still perfectly blended into it; no pixel-hunting was required as they were in most cases clearly visible. On the other hand, I would have preferred if the items were automatically discarded from the inventory if they had no further use. As it is now, the inventory is often filled with non-relevant items that were previously gathered.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2228779642348537971/2326108E325E44ADE118E776B6CD49544C89204F/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The aspect in which&nbsp;<em>Monolith</em>&nbsp;shines is the enigmatic atmosphere that it conveys and the strong cinematic component of the game. It’s probably one of the most cinematic point &amp; click experiences I’ve had, filled with beautifully hand-drawn video cutscenes and ample dialogue snippets. Unlike in older point &amp; click games, where a certain character has multiple dialogue options of which the majority are rather irrelevant to the story,&nbsp;<em>Monolith</em>&nbsp;transforms its dialogues into lengthy cutscenes that will always add something new to the plot or reveal some important piece of information for the story. The game is also fully voiced in both English and German and overall has some decent voice acting (with some small exceptions when the lines voiced by Tessa’s robot companion don’t flow smoothly). Judging by the German demo video, the English voice-overs are much better than the German ones.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2228779642348538550/9B679CB6558DBFFC7D6F857ED58263D7B80AAEA8/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For those that prefer a more casual approach at point &amp; click games, three important features have been added to the game: a hotspot button that reveals all interactable items, an in-game walkthrough with only the relevant section visible for the room you’re in, and all minigames can be skipped. Using any of these will not prevent you from obtaining 100% completion, however, all 14 achievements are missable. As there is no chapter selection at the moment, you’ll need to rely heavily on an achievement guide if you want to obtain all of them. The game does have a save feature which is helpful if you want to replay certain bits. It comes in handy for those achievements that require you to solve a minigame in a certain amount of steps / in a specific way, or under a time limit (don’t worry, the latter is very easy).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2228779642348538237/36D3CBC70A51A104B5757A10032E799701A6FD74/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>While I deeply enjoy playing point &amp; click games, I dislike certain aspects of the core gameplay of the older games, such as pixel-hunting, lots of back &amp; forth between scenes and illogical puzzles. <em>Monolith</em> successfully managed to avoid pretty much all my pet peeves, while also providing enough verbal guidance for puzzles (during world interactions or when examining inventory items) as well as through the hotspots map and the in-game walkthrough. The game’s difficulty is just about right and it doesn’t interrupt the immersion given by the generous amount of movie-like cutscenes. The story was engaging and kept me on my toes until close to the end. Both Tessa as well as her companion robot are likable characters. Their dialogue exchanges are fun and filled with snappy remarks. All in all, <em>Monolith</em> was a very pleasant experience.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2228779642348538823/C7C8313CD0C8076BD803D706870EAD2CF1D6FB91/?imw=5000&amp;imh=5000&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=false\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/></figure>\\n\\n\\n<iframe id=\\\"wp-steam-shortcode\\\" class=\\\"wp-steam-shortcode\\\" style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 190px; border: 0;\\\" src=\\\"//store.steampowered.com/widget/1542390?t=\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\"></iframe>\\n<p>The post <a href=\\\"https://lillycorner.com/2023/11/14/monolith/\\\">Monolith</a> appeared first on <a href=\\\"https://lillycorner.com\\\">Lilly&#039;s Corner Reviews</a>.</p>\\n\",\n      \"media\": {}\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"https://lillycorner.com/?p=1048\",\n      \"title\": \"Delicious &#8211; Cooking and Romance\",\n      \"description\": \"<p>What makes a game truly delicious?
